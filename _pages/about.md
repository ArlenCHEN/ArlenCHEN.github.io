Hello! I am a PhD student in the Intelligent Systems Engineering department at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/). I am a member of [Vehicle Autonomy and Intelligence Lab (VAIL)](https://vail.sice.indiana.edu/), directed by Professor [Lantao Liu](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~lantao/).

My research interests include perception, deep learning and autonomous navigation in robotics domain.
* _Perception_ is to understand the surrounding environments using certain sensor measurements, e.g., point clouds or images. I have been working on developing geometric-based methods to process **Point Clouds** [(RA-L)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387081) and **Images** [(ICRA'21)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561353) such that the perception information could be efficiently and robustly utilized for planning during the mission.
* _Deep Learning_ is an extremely important learning-based method for solving preception problems. Applications of deep learning in robotics are strictly limited due to the availability of training data. I have been working on developing models with **Unsupervised-learning-based paradigm** ([NeurIPS'21-ML4AD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01127.pdf), [submitted to ICRA'22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00063.pdf)) and with **Domain Adaptation** (Ongoing work) for constructing navigable space and extracting semantic information.
* _Autonomous Navigation_ is a fundamental capability for deploying mobile robots in the real world. I have been working on developing methods for **Visual Navigation** [(submitted to ICRA'22)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00063.pdf) and **Exploration** [(ArXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00067.pdf).
